We thought the Snapchat app could use a more efficient design. In particular, we wanted to improve the workflow for reviewing snaps and messages. This is our UI prototype.

Features:
* Merging the snaps view and story view
* Bubbles:
  * Tap to view snaps
  * Double tap to view story
  * Long press for friend details
  * Badges for unread count

Other features that we didn't get to implementing:
* Chat interface
* Memories
* Ring around bubble for unviewed story
